# World_Weather_Analysis

Write-up

The goal of this project was to create changes to take a PlanMyTrip app to add weather to descriptions of potential tourists using the weather data obtained through APIs. Using these APIs, we created three projects:

A Weather Database that compiles weather in all major tourist attractions across the world
A Vacation Search database that compiles the popular vacation locations with hotels based on their preferred minimum and maximum temperatures.
A Database that allows a potential tourist to create an itinerary using four cities they wish to travel.

Through these, the Google Maps API was used as well as a Weather API to compile the data from real world sources.
